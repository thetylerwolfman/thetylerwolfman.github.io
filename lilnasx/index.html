<p>Please keep in mind that there may be some NSFW concepts in the songs, don't blame me; blame the neural network. :)</p>

<p>I currently have one song created using the top 15 Lil Nas X songs according to <a href="https://genius.com">Genius</a>. And I have only used a max depth of 5, I plan on training it a lot longer and much more data in the future.</p>
